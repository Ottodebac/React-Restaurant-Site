          A procession of deftly sliced, shaped, torched and brushed nigiri,
          presented on a gleaming lacquered plate. An exploration of tastes and
          textures; a sensory journey between the oceans of Japan and Australia.

            Omakase is a culinary experience led by the chef, the produce and
            the seasons. We offer two dining areas: the counter seating style
            sushi bar for up to two guests; and the dining room for gatherings
            of three and above. In both, we serve an omakase of nigiri and
            Japanese cuisine bound by a common thread â€” meticulousness,
            precision, technique and exquisite produce.
