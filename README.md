## Features

- **React Router:** The project utilizes React Router for handling navigation and rendering different pages based on the URL path.
- **Navbar and Footer:** The `Navbar` and `Footer` components are reusable components that can be customized and extended according to the restaurant's branding.
- **Pages:** The project includes several pages, including Home, About, Menu, and Contact. These pages can be modified and expanded to suit the specific needs of the restaurant.

## Usage

The project follows a simple structure. The `App` component acts as the main entry point and sets up the router. It renders the `Navbar`, `Routes`, and `Footer` components, which handle the navigation and rendering of the different pages.

To add or modify pages, you can create new components for each page and add corresponding routes in the `Routes` component within the `App` component. You can customize the `Navbar` and `Footer` components to match the design and branding of the restaurant.

Feel free to explore the project's code and make changes as needed to suit your specific requirements. Enjoy building your restaurant website!
